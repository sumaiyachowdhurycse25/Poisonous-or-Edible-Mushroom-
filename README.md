  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p> Mushroom is a delicacy relished by people all over the world. It has great medical benefits 
as well. But not all mushrooms can be digested and can lead to even death. Some 
mushrooms are edible and some of them are poisonous. So, it is essential to distinguish 
poisonous mushrooms from the edible ones. To detect it manually can be laborious, time 
consuming and inaccurate. This project presents machine learning techniques to distinguish between poisonous mushroom and edible mushroom. 8 machine 
learning algorithms such as Decision tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, 
Support Vector Machine, Perceptron, ZeroR Classifier, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest 
have been applied on a dataset samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms 
in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom. Some exploratory data analysis have been 
performed on the dataset for a better understanding of the attributes.</p>
